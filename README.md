# Professional Experience

**Clinical informatician** at the VA Center for Innovations in Quality,
Effectiveness and Safety (IQuESt), and at the Baylor Institute for
Clinical and Translational Research, 11/12/2018-present. **Assistant
professor,** Baylor College of Medicine. I am a practicing physician
with with significant personal experience writing reusable **database,
statistical, and machine learning** computer code for research. I unify
large collections of fragmented data elements to into clinically
meaningful concepts, thus making diverse clinical research studies
possible. This work is known by several names: *secondary use* of
electronic health record data, *clinical research informatics,* or
*phenotyping.* I interpret clinical language and systems for data pull
engineers/analysts, or vice versa (interpreting technical language for
clinical investigators). I access a data warehouse covering $> 20$
million unique individuals, and billions of observations, from 1999 to
the present, aggregated from 130 VA sites (but incompletely
standardized/harmonized). Major projects include disseminating
algorithms to detect missed laboratory test follow-ups, and clinical
trials matching. I also work as a **teaching attending** on the VA
hospitalist service, supervising house staff and students. Supervisors:
Hardeep Singh, Chris Amos, Andrew Caruso, Lindsey Gay.

**Clinical informatician,** Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research
and Information Center (MAVERIC), 10/20/2014-11/9/2018. **Assistant
professor,** Boston University School of Medicine, 8/2016-11/2018, and
reciprocal appointment as Lecturer, Harvard Medical School. My work
enabled a **genomic precision medicine** platform and learning health
system for cancer, as well as a 13,000-subject point of care, randomized
**comparative effectiveness trial** of two antihypertensives. Developed
(2016) a system to ensure **reusable phenotyping algorithms** for
genomic association and other studies, still in use as of 2024.
Personally exported and encrypted data from this system to the mirror
system at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (2018). Served as
**co-program-director** of the Big Data-Scientist Training Enhancement
Program (BD-STEP) site in Boston, and as principal investigator on a
study of genomic predictors of stage of lung cancer at presentation.
Mentored an internal medicine resident, who helped me make a highly
