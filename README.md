# Professional Experience

**Clinical informatician** at the VA Center for Innovations in Quality,
Effectiveness and Safety (IQuESt), and at the Baylor Institute for
Clinical and Translational Research, 11/12/2018-present. **Assistant
professor,** Baylor College of Medicine. I am a clinical subject matter
expert who reviews large collections of fragmented data elements to
unify them into clinically meaningful concepts, thus making diverse
clinical research studies possible. These efforts are often termed
**secondary use** of electronic health record data, or **clinical
research informatics.** I interpret clinical language and systems for
data pull engineers/analysts, or vice versa (interpreting technical
language for clinical investigators). I access a data warehouse covering
twenty million unique individuals, and billions of observations, from
1999 to the present, aggregated from 130 VA sites (but incompletely
standardized/harmonized). Major projects include disseminating
algorithms to detect missed laboratory test follow-ups, and clinical
trials matching. I work as a **teaching attending** on the VA inpatient
medicine service, supervising house staff and students. Supervisors:
Hardeep Singh, Laura Petersen, Chris Amos, Andrew Caruso.

**Clinical informatician,** Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research
and Information Center (MAVERIC), 10/20/2014-11/9/2018. **Assistant
professor,** Boston University School of Medicine, 8/2016-11/2018, and
reciprocal appointment as Lecturer, Harvard Medical School. My work
enabled a **genomic precision medicine** platform and learning health
system for cancer, as well as a 13,000-subject point of care, randomized
**comparative effectiveness trial** of two antihypertensives. I
developed (2016) a system to ensure **reusable phenotyping algorithms**
for genomic association and other studies, and I directly exported and
encrypted data for transfer to the mirror system adopted at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory (2018). I collaborated on writing and submission of
a U01 grant. I served as **co-program-director** of the Big
Data-Scientist Training Enhancement Program (BD-STEP) site in Boston,
and served as principal investigator on a study of genomic predictors of
stage of lung cancer at presentation. I mentored an internal medicine
resident, who helped me make a highly accurate **natural language
processing classifier** of serum protein electrophoresis reports.
Inpatient medicine **teaching attending** at the VA hospital.
Supervisors (research): Nhan Do, Valmeek Kudesia, Mary Brophy, Louis
Fiore. Clinical: Steven Simon, Jay Orlander, Anthony Breu.

**Research collaborator,** Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Laboratory for Computational Physiology, 12/6/2013-9/2016. Lead
clinician on a project to develop a data-based definition of acute
kidney injury, using records of 11,000 patients from MIMIC II, an open
collection of intensive care unit data collected over 8 years.
Collaborated on writing and submission of an NIH R25 grant. Professor:
Leo Celi, Harvard-MIT Division of Health Science and Technology.

**Research fellow,** Children's Hospital Informatics Program,
Intelligent Health Laboratory, 7/1/2011-1/31/2014. Analyzed pharmacy
claims to develop predictive models of medication adherence. Used **SAS
software and multivariable logistic regression** to analyze 61 million
enrollment records, 200 million medical claims, and 90 million
prescription claims. I designed and wrote all code to perform the
analysis, resulting in 2,000 lines of code in the final project. Other
data and methods included laboratory and health risk assessment data,
multivariable adaptive regression splines, and Fourier spectral
analysis. Coursework in **epidemiology, biostatistics, data mining,
machine learning, and grant writing,** partially through Harvard School
of Public Health Program in Clinical Effectiveness. Professor: Kenneth
Mandl, Harvard Medical School. Program director: Alexa McCray, Harvard
Medical School.

**Urgent care physician,** Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates,
10/15/2011-6/30/2018. Diagnose and treat patients with acute medical
problems, e.g. respiratory or gastrointestinal infections, dehydration,
sprains, abscesses, lacerations, pelvic conditions, initial management
of fractures. Supervise nurse practitioners and physician assistants.
Supervisor: David Meenan.

**Internal medicine chief resident,** Saint Louis University Hospital,
7/1/2010-6/30/2011. Managed and scheduled 130 residents. Academic
appointment as instructor in internal medicine and hospital appointment
as physician. Attended on inpatient & outpatient general medicine in
university and VA hospitals. Accepted transfers, supervised and improved
patient handoffs. Precepted medical students, ran approximately 100
resident report conferences, 6 morbidity and mortality conferences, and
two clinicopathologic conferences. Interviewed residency program
applicants and sat on selection committee. Program director: Miguel
Paniagua, Saint Louis University.

**Research elective,** 2/2007-4/2007. Analyzed associations in a
database of 12,000 outpatients associated with 40,000 diagnoses. Wrote
Perl code to find associations between any given pair of diseases in a
patient, and to output the strongest associations in an easily
visualized format. Professor: Walton Sumner, Washington University in
St. Louis.

**Professorial assistant,** 9/1998-5/2002. Used molecular biology and
cell culture techniques to analyze factors leading to malignant
transformation of human cells. Professor: J. Justin McCormick, Michigan
State University.

**Technology skills.** Experience with **SAS** and **R** statistical
programming, **Git** source code management, and **SQL** all since 2011;
and with the **Python** programming language since 2013. GitHub
username: zimolzak (have written code involving topics such as a Twitter
