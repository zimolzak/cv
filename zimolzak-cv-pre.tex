\section*{Professional Experience} % reverse chron

\textbf{Clinical informatician} at the VA Center for Innovations in
Quality, Effectiveness and Safety (IQuESt), and at the Baylor
Institute for Clinical and Translational Research,
11/12/2018\ndash{}present. \textbf{Assistant professor,} Baylor
College of Medicine. I am a practicing physician with with significant
personal experience writing reusable \textbf{database, statistical,
  and machine learning} computer code for research. I unify large
collections of fragmented data elements to into clinically meaningful
concepts, thus making diverse clinical research studies possible. This
work is known by several names: \emph{secondary use} of electronic
health record data, \emph{clinical research informatics,} or
\emph{phenotyping.} I interpret clinical language and systems for data
pull engineers/analysts, or vice versa (interpreting technical
language for clinical investigators). I access a data warehouse
covering $> 20$ million unique individuals, and billions of
observations, from 1999 to the present, aggregated from 130 VA sites
(but incompletely standardized/harmonized). Major projects include
disseminating algorithms to detect missed laboratory test follow-ups,
and clinical trials matching. I also work as a \textbf{teaching
  attending} on the VA hospitalist service, supervising house staff
and students. Supervisors: Hardeep Singh, Chris Amos, Andrew Caruso,
Lindsey Gay.

\textbf{Clinical informatician,} Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology
Research and Information Center (MAVERIC),
10/20/\linebreak[0]2014\ndash{}11/9/2018. \textbf{Assistant
  professor,} Boston University School of Medicine,
8/2016\ndash{}11/2018, and reciprocal appointment as Lecturer, Harvard
Medical School. My work enabled a \textbf{genomic precision medicine}
platform and learning health system for cancer, as well as a
13,000-subject point of care, randomized \textbf{comparative
  effectiveness trial} of two antihypertensives. Developed (2016) a
system to ensure \textbf{reusable phenotyping algorithms} for genomic
association and other studies, still in use as of 2024. Personally
exported and encrypted data from this system to the mirror system at
Oak Ridge National Laboratory (2018). Served as \textbf{co-program-director} of
the Big Data-Scientist Training Enhancement Program (BD-STEP) site in
Boston, and as principal investigator on a study of genomic predictors
of stage of lung cancer at presentation. Mentored an internal
medicine resident, who helped me make a highly accurate
\textbf{natural language processing classifier} of serum protein
electrophoresis reports. Inpatient medicine \textbf{teaching
