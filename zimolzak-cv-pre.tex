\section*{Professional Experience} % reverse chron

\textbf{Clinical informatician} at the VA Center for Innovations in
Quality, Effectiveness and Safety (IQuESt), and at the Baylor
Institute for Clinical and Translational Research,
11/12/2018\ndash{}present. \textbf{Assistant professor,} Baylor
College of Medicine. I am a clinical subject matter expert who reviews
large collections of fragmented data elements to unify them into
clinically meaningful concepts, thus making diverse clinical research
studies possible.  These efforts are often termed \textbf{secondary
  use} of electronic health record data, or \textbf{clinical research
  informatics.} I interpret clinical language and systems for data
pull engineers/analysts, or vice versa (interpreting technical
language for clinical investigators). I access a data warehouse
covering twenty million unique individuals, and billions of
observations, from 1999 to the present, aggregated from 130 VA sites
(but incompletely standardized/harmonized). Major projects include
disseminating algorithms to detect missed laboratory test follow-ups,
and clinical trials matching. I work as a \textbf{teaching
  attending} on the VA inpatient medicine service, supervising house
staff and students. Supervisors: Hardeep Singh, Laura
Petersen, Chris Amos, Andrew Caruso.

\textbf{Clinical informatician,} Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology
Research and Information Center (MAVERIC),
10/20/\linebreak[0]2014\ndash{}11/9/2018. \textbf{Assistant
  professor,} Boston University School of Medicine,
8/2016\ndash{}11/2018, and reciprocal appointment as Lecturer, Harvard
Medical School. My work enabled a \textbf{genomic precision medicine}
platform and learning health system for cancer, as well as
a 13,000-subject point of care, randomized \textbf{comparative
  effectiveness trial} of two antihypertensives. I developed (2016) a system
to ensure \textbf{reusable phenotyping algorithms} for genomic
association and other studies, and I directly exported and encrypted
data for transfer to the mirror system adopted at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory (2018). I collaborated on writing and submission of a
U01 grant. I served as \textbf{co-program-director} of the Big
Data-Scientist Training Enhancement Program (BD-STEP) site in Boston,
and served as principal investigator on a study of genomic predictors
of stage of lung cancer at presentation. I mentored an internal
medicine resident, who helped me make a highly accurate
\textbf{natural language processing classifier} of serum protein
electrophoresis reports. Inpatient medicine \textbf{teaching
  attending} at the VA hospital. Supervisors (research): Nhan Do,
Valmeek Kudesia, Mary Brophy, Louis Fiore. Clinical: Steven Simon, Jay
Orlander, Anthony Breu.

\textbf{Research collaborator,} Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Laboratory for Computational Physiology,
12/6/2013\ndash{}\linebreak[0]9/2016. Lead clinician on a project to
develop a data-based definition of acute kidney injury, using records
of 11,000 patients from MIMIC II, an open collection of intensive care
unit data collected over 8 years. Collaborated on writing and
submission of an NIH R25 grant. Professor: Leo Celi, Harvard-MIT
Division of Health Science and Technology.

\textbf{Research fellow,} Children's Hospital Informatics Program,
Intelligent Health Lab\-o\-ra\-to\-ry,
\linebreak[0]7/1/\linebreak[0]2011\ndash{}\linebreak[0]1/31/2014.
Analyzed pharmacy claims to develop predictive models of medication
adherence. Used \textbf{SAS software and multivariable logistic
  regression} to analyze 61 million enrollment records, 200 million
medical claims, and 90 million prescription claims. I designed and
wrote all code to perform the analysis, resulting in 2,000 lines of
code in the final project. Other data and methods included laboratory
and health risk assessment data, multivariable adaptive regression
splines, and Fourier spectral analysis. Coursework in
\textbf{epidemiology, biostatistics, data mining, machine learning,
  and grant writing,} partially through Harvard School of Public
Health Program in Clinical Effectiveness. Professor: Kenneth Mandl,
Harvard Medical School. Program director: Alexa McCray, Harvard
Medical School.

\textbf{Urgent care physician,} Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates,
10/15/2011\ndash{}6/30/2018. Diagnose and treat patients with acute
medical problems, e.g.\ respiratory or gastrointestinal infections,
dehydration, sprains, abscesses, lacerations, pelvic conditions,
initial management of fractures. Supervise nurse practitioners and
physician assistants. Supervisor: David Meenan.

\textbf{Internal medicine chief resident,} Saint Louis University
Hospital, 7/1/2010\ndash\linebreak[0]6/30/\linebreak[0]2011. Managed
and scheduled 130 residents. Academic appointment as instructor in
internal medicine and hospital appointment as physician. Attended on
inpatient \& outpatient general medicine in university and VA
hospitals. Accepted transfers, supervised and improved patient
handoffs. Precepted medical students, ran approximately 100 resident
report conferences, 6 morbidity and mortality conferences, and two
clinicopathologic conferences. Interviewed residency program
applicants and sat on selection committee. Program director: Miguel
Paniagua, Saint Louis University.

\textbf{Research elective,} 2/2007\ndash4/2007. Analyzed associations
in a database of 12,000 outpatients associated with 40,000 diagnoses.
Wrote Perl code to find associations between any given pair of
diseases in a patient, and to output the strongest associations in an
easily visualized format. Professor: Walton Sumner, Washington
University in St.\ Louis.

\textbf{Professorial assistant,} 9/1998\ndash5/2002. Used molecular
biology and cell culture techniques to analyze factors leading to
malignant transformation of human cells. Professor: J.\ Justin
McCormick, Michigan State University.

\textbf{Technology skills.} Experience with \textbf{SAS} and \textbf{R} statistical
programming, \textbf{Git} source code management, and \textbf{SQL} all since 2011; and
