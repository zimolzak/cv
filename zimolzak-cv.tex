\section*{Professional Experience} % reverse chronol.

\textbf{Clinical informatician,} Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology
Research and Information Center (MAVERIC), 10/20/2014\ndash{}present.
I am a clinical subject matter expert who reviews large collections of
fragmented data elements to unify them into a single clinical concept.
These elements come from a data warehouse covering twenty million
unique individuals, from 1999 to the present, and aggregated from 130
VA sites. I work with three main projects: a precision medicine
platform and ultimately learning health system for cancer; a platform
for point of care, randomized comparative effectiveness trials of
medications; and the early stages of a sponsored hepatitis C
observational cohort study. For the third project, I am the principal
investigator. I am also developing a system to ensure that the data
cleaning or harmonization efforts of our research group and other
groups are reproducible and reusable across the whole VA. I work with
multiple other VA studies, translating between clinical investigators
and data pull engineers/analysts or natural language processing
experts. Finally, I work as a teaching attending on the inpatient
medicine service and for a physical diagnosis course. I have
supervised house staff and students from three residency programs, one
medical school, and one interdisciplinary PhD program (Boston Medical
Center, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Brigham and Women's
Hospital, Harvard Medical School, and Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and
Technology). Supervisors (research): Valmeek Kudesia, Louis Fiore.
Supervisors (clinical): Steven Simon, Jay Orlander, Anthony Breu.

\textbf{Research collaborator,} Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Laboratory for Computational Physiology, 12/6/2013\ndash{}present.
Lead clinician / subject matter expert on a project to develop a
data-based definition of acute kidney injury, using the clinical
records of 11,000 patients from MIMIC II, a large, open database of
collected intensive care unit data. Collaborate on writing and
submission of an NIH R25 grant, pertaining to open educational
resources for biomedical big data, and courses for skills development
in biomedical big data science. Professor: Leo Celi, Harvard-MIT
Division of Health Science and Technology.

\textbf{Research fellow,} Children’s Hospital Informatics Program,
Intelligent Health Lab\-o\-ra\-to\-ry,
\linebreak[0]7/1/\linebreak[0]2011\ndash{}\linebreak[0]1/31/2014.
Analyzed large pharmacy claims databases to develop predictive models
of medication adherence. Used SAS software to operate on the primary
data set from Aetna, Inc., which selected commercial insurance members
with hyperlipidemia and comprised 61 million enrollment records, 200
million medical claims, and 90 million prescription claims. Secondary
data sets included laboratory and health risk assessment data.
Performed modeling using multivariable logistic regression and
multivariable adaptive regression splines. Quantified prescription
refill irregularity using Fourier spectral analysis. Took coursework
including Harvard School of Public Health Program in Clinical
Effectiveness (introductory epidemiology, biostatistics, health
services research, pharmacoepidemiology), biomedical informatics, data
mining \& statistical machine learning, population health informatics,
business \& management, and grant writing. Professor: Kenneth Mandl,
Harvard Medical School. Funded by a National Library of Medicine grant
to program director Alexa McCray, Harvard Medical School.

\textbf{Urgent care physician,} Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates,
10/15/2011\ndash{}present. Diagnose and treat patients with acute
medical problems, including common respiratory and gastrointestinal
infections, sprains \& strains, abscesses, simple lacerations, pelvic
conditions, and initial management of fractures. Supervise and consult
with nurse practitioners and physician assistants as needed. Respond
to “code blue” emergencies in the building. Interpret urgent
radiographs, electrocardiograms, and laboratory tests. Our clinic
capabilities include intravenous fluids and intravenous antibiotics.
Supervisor: David Meenan, 133 Brookline Ave, Boston MA 02215.
