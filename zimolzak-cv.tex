\section*{Professional Experience} % reverse chronol.

\textbf{Clinical informatician,} Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology
Research and Information Center (MAVERIC),
10/20/\linebreak[0]2014\ndash{}present. \textbf{Assistant professor,}
Boston University School of Medicine, 8/2016\ndash{}present. I am a
clinical subject matter expert who reviews large collections of
fragmented data elements to unify them into a single clinical concept.
These elements come from a data warehouse covering twenty million
unique individuals, from 1999 to the present, aggregated from 130 VA
sites. I work with three main projects: a precision medicine platform
and ultimately learning health system for cancer; a platform for point
of care, randomized comparative effectiveness trials of medications;
and the early stages of a sponsored hepatitis C observational cohort
study. I am also developing a system to ensure that the data cleaning
or harmonization efforts of our research group and other groups are
reproducible and reusable across the whole VA. I work with multiple
other VA studies, translating between clinical investigators and data
pull engineers/analysts or natural language processing experts.
Finally, I work as a teaching attending on the inpatient medicine
service and for a physical diagnosis course. I supervise house staff
and students from three residency programs, two medical schools, and
an interdisciplinary PhD program. Supervisors (research): Valmeek
Kudesia, Louis Fiore. Supervisors (clinical, educational): Steven
Simon, Jay Orlander, Anthony Breu, Sarah Grudberg.

\textbf{Research collaborator,} Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Laboratory for Computational Physiology,
12/6/2013\ndash{}\linebreak[0]present. Lead clinician on a project to
develop a data-based definition of acute kidney injury, using records

Analyzed pharmacy claims to develop predictive models of medication
adherence. Used SAS software and multivariable logistic regression to
analyze 61 million enrollment records, 200 million medical claims, and
90 million prescription claims. Other data and methods included
laboratory and health risk assessment data, multivariable adaptive
regression splines, and Fourier spectral analysis. Coursework included
Harvard School of Public Health Program in Clinical Effectiveness,
data mining, machine learning, and grant writing. Professor: Kenneth
Mandl, Harvard Medical School. Program director: Alexa McCray, Harvard
Medical School.

\textbf{Urgent care physician,} Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates,
10/15/2011\ndash{}present. Diagnose and treat patients with acute
